This is an extension for [KUAL](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326) which when used with KUAL allows launching fread.ink from the original UI.

# Usage

To use, copy the `extensions/` directory to the root of your kindle, then find the KUAL "book" on your kindle and select it. After a few seconds you should see a menu where one of the menu items labeled "Switch to fread". Select this menu item to launch fread.

This assumes that you have already installed fread itself to the `/fread` directory on your kindle's fat32 partition.

This extension has only been tested with KUAL version 2.7
